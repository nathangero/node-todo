# Node/Express.js Server for Todo Apps

## Description

This is a simple serve to make it easy to test out other frontend frameworks for a full-stack application. This is the `node.js` server for my [Angular Todo App](https://github.com/nathangero/angular-todo) and my [React Todo App](https://github.com/nathangero/react-todo). 

This is build with `TypeScript` and `Express.js`.

This does simple CRUD operations for a todo list. It handles adding, updating, and deleting a todo. 

## Installation

1. Download the code
2. Open the terminal/command prompt, navigate to where you downloaded the code, and run `npm run dev`.
3. Make sure to download my front end code to fully test the full stack application.
